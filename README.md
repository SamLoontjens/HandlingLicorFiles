'##HandlingLicorFiles'

Description;\
This is a package for handling Li-6400 and Li-6800 output files for data analysis.

Why the project is useful;\
This package lets you use a bunch of extra functions. It can make plotting and analysis of Licor output files very fast. Then you have extra time for measurements or learning other stuff! :)

How you can get started with this R package;
- Install the latest R version                     https://cran.r-project.org/
- Install the latest Rtools version (I'm not sure if this is recuired)               https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/
- Install the latest Rstudio version (recommended)   https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

In R studio do the following;
- Install latest Devtools package        
```
$ install.packages("Devtools")
```
- Load Devtools package     
```
$ library(Devtools)
```
- Install this package 
```
$ install_github("SamLoontjens/HandlingLicorFiles")
```
- Load this package                      
```
$ library(HandlingLicorFiles)
```
Now you can use all the functions! like say_hi()

Note: The dollar sign $ means run in the R Console.
